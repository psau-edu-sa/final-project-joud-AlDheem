In this project, the TikTok application was studied in a simplified form and as a small project

me and my team discussed how long this program would take to build, 
what are the functional and non-functional requirements, and the purpose of the Tik Tok application. The system was analyzed using UML such as: activity, use case, sequence, class diagram.
